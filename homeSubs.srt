1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 
Hey, uh, Holander, he's just, he's a human.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000 
He's just like the rest of us.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000 
We all make mistakes, right?

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000 
But we all deserve second chances.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
In that spirit, Holander has agreed to donate ten million dollars to the Starlight House,

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
which, I mean, come on.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000 
No, no, no, no.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000 
Starlight lied to you just now.

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
She did.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000 
I don't make mistakes.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000 
I'm not just like the rest of you.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000 
I'm stronger.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000 
I'm smarter.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000 
I'm better.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 
I am better.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
I'm not some weak-need fucking cry baby that goes around fucking apologizing all the time.

17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000 
And why the fuck would you want me to be?

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
What fucking commercial, Roger?

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000 
Go to fucking commercial?

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
Don't you dare stop rolling, Roger.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 
All my life, people have tried to control me.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000 
My whole life, rich people, powerful people, tried to muzzle me, cancel me, keep me impotent and obedient,

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000 
like I'm a fucking puppet.

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000 
You know what, it worked.

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000 
Because I allowed it to work.

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000 
And guess what?

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000 
If they can control me, then you can bet your ass they can control you.

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 
They already do, you just don't realize it.

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000 
I'm done.

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 
I am done apologizing.

31
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000 
I am done being persecuted for my strength.

32
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000 
You people should be thanking Christ that I am who and what I am because you need me.

33
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000 
You need me to save you.

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000 
You do.

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000 
I am the only one who possibly can.

36
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000 
You're not the real heroes.

37
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000 
I'm the real hero.

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 
I'm the real hero.
